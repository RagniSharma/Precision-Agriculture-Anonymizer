# Precision-Agriculture-Anonymizer

this program uses anonymization in precision agriculture wherein 
the details of transaction are anonymized and are tokenized thereby keeping the privacy intact

1. The code is written in Python and uses the hashlib, json, datetime, and numpy libraries.
2. The code defines a Blockchain class that contains a chain and transactions array, and a difficulty level for mining blocks.
3. The code also contains several methods like create_block(), previous_block(), proof_of_work(), valid_proof(), hash_block(), add_transaction(), valid_chain(), hash_transaction(), and get_block_by_index().
4. The create_block() method creates a new block and adds it to the chain.
5. The proof_of_work() method calculates the nonce required for mining a new block using the valid_proof() method.
6. The valid_proof() method checks if the proof of work is valid or not.
7. The hash_block() method calculates the hash of the block.
8. The add_transaction() method adds a new transaction to the transactions array.
9. The valid_chain() method checks if the current blockchain is valid or not.
10. The hash_transaction() method calculates the hash of a given transaction.
11. The main() function initializes the blockchain, defines some transactions, adds them to the blockchain, mines a new block, and checks the validity of the blockchain using the valid_chain() method.
